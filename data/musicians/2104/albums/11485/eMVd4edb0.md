## 歌词

<div>
all these years<br><br>
词：顺子 曲：顺子 编曲：王继康<br><br>
all that i saw and all that i heard<br><br>
everything that i felt and all that i learned<br><br>
you helped me see it, you even made me listen<br><br>
you gave me your friendship, what i had been missing<br><br>
all these years and all this space<br><br>
between all these countries we still kept faith<br><br>
all these words, so much to say<br><br>
i am so grateful-you paved the way<br><br>
we may not look alike and our ideas may differ<br><br>
but every minute of our lives, we breathe as sisters<br><br>
it's never too late, it doesn't matter when or where<br><br>
i found my best friend again you, you're always there<br><br>
all these years and all this space between all these countries<br><br>
we still kept faithall these words,<br><br>
so much to say well, i am so grateful you, you paved the way<br><br>
two breaths from the same mother teardrops by the same father<br><br>
two ears that heard the same sound two sisters that grew up proud<br><br>
two petals from the same flower memories of the same home<br><br>
two fighting for the same cause we both wept from the same loss<br><br>
all these years and all this space<br><br>
between all these countries we still kept faith<br><br>
all these words, so much to say<br><br>
well, i am so grateful you paved the way<br><br>
all these years and all this spacebetween<br><br>
all these countries we still kept faith<br><br>
all these words, so much to say<br><br>
well, i am so grateful-you, you paved the way
