## 歌词

<div>
the night has come when love and tenderness were in a fog<br><br>
you came alone and shed your warmth on everyone you found<br><br>
envious eyes were prying right into his eyes <br><br>
to pleasantly laying a trap of love <br><br>
i'm waiting to seize your love<br><br>
<br><br>
contemptible in a glass of wine i hide my heart and soul<br><br>
irresistible he fell for me inder my masquerade<br><br>
envious eyes were prying right into his eyes<br><br>
to pleasantly laying a trap of love <br><br>
i'm waiting to seize your love <br><br>
envious eyes <br><br>
to see him right through in his mind <br><br>
to pleasantly laying a trap of love<br><br>
i'm going to get your love
</div>
