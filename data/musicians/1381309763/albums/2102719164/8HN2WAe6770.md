## 歌词

<div>
Daddy's from the do your own thing generation<br><br>
No I'm not afraid of mud or grime or dirt<br><br>
But you boys must understand<br><br>
There's a line drawn in the sand<br><br>
Don't wipe your face on your shirt<br><br>
Oh you could have that<br><br>
Bowl of ice cream for your breakfast<br><br>
I'll let you do that<br><br>
Just so long as you have green beans for dessert<br><br>
I'd let you eat that can of lard<br><br>
But when you throw up in the yard<br><br>
Just don't wipe your face on your shirt<br><br>
Well your parents are musicians<br><br>
And we must convince the neighbors<br><br>
We're civilized in our end of the block<br><br>
According to dear your mother<br><br>
What am I supposed to tell the<br><br>
Kaleshoes and habers<br><br>
If they see you running 'round<br><br>
With food or mucus on your smock<br><br>
You can play like you're a pirate<br><br>
In that mud paddle<br><br>
Ah even though you're just a little sport<br><br>
With big mask if you want<br><br>
You could make a lot of noise<br><br>
But I'll always love you boys<br><br>
Just don't wipe your face on your shirt<br><br>
Oh now<br><br>
Well your parents are musicians<br><br>
I hate to break it to you ninos<br><br>
There's one thing that the neighbors must believe<br><br>
They gotta think we're civilized<br><br>
What am I supposed to tell<br><br>
The steinards and trevinos<br><br>
If they see you running 'round<br><br>
With some saliva on your sleeve<br><br>
You can even talk religion<br><br>
With your grandma<br><br>
Right grannyme<br><br>
Though it means that someone's getting hurt<br><br>
Just remember keep your poise<br><br>
I'll always love you boys<br><br>
Just don't wipe your face on your shirt<br><br>
I'm serious gentlemen<br><br>
Don't wipe your face on your shirt
