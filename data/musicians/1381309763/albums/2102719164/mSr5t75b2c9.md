## 歌词

<div>
Goosey goosey gander<br><br>
<br><br>
Whither shall I wander<br><br>
<br><br>
Upstairs and downstairs<br><br>
And in my lady's chamber<br><br>
<br><br>
There I met an old man<br><br>
Who wouldn't say his prayers<br><br>
<br><br>
I took him by the left leg<br><br>
And threw him down the stairs<br><br>
<br><br>
Goosey goosey gander<br><br>
<br><br>
Whither shall I wander<br><br>
<br><br>
Upstairs and downstairs<br><br>
<br><br>
And in my lady's chamber<br><br>
<br><br>
There I met an old man<br><br>
Who wouldn't say his prayers<br><br>
<br><br>
I took him by the left leg<br><br>
And threw him down the stairs
