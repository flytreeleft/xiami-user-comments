## 歌词

<div>
I closed my eyes back the curtain<br><br>
<br><br>
To see for certain what I thought I knew<br><br>
<br><br>
Far far away someone was sleeping<br><br>
<br><br>
But the world was sleeping any dream will do<br><br>
<br><br>
I wore my coat with golden lining<br><br>
<br><br>
Bright colors shinning and the dream is too<br><br>
<br><br>
The world and I we are still waiting<br><br>
<br><br>
Still hesitating any dream will do<br><br>
<br><br>
A crash of drums a flash of light<br><br>
My golden coat flew out of sight<br><br>
The colors faded into darkness<br><br>
I was left alone<br><br>
<br><br>
May I return to the beginning<br><br>
<br><br>
The light is dimming and the dream is too<br><br>
<br><br>
The world and I we are still waiting<br><br>
<br><br>
Still hesitating
</div>
