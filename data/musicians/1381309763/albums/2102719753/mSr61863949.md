## 歌词

<div>
Turtle bob is a friend of mine<br><br>
<br><br>
He likes to frolic in the warm sunshine<br><br>
<br><br>
He could play in lime tree bay all day<br><br>
<br><br>
Just off the coast of his island in the sun<br><br>
<br><br>
Is the perfect place for turtle bob to have some fun<br><br>
<br><br>
He gets around from north sound to bodden town<br><br>
<br><br>
But his favorite place to go is<br><br>
Stingray city on the ocean floor<br><br>
<br><br>
With friendly fish and a reef to explore<br><br>
<br><br>
Coral gardens and a sandbar too<br><br>
<br><br>
Come on down so turtle bob can swim with you<br><br>
Beneath the surface it's a festival down there<br><br>
<br><br>
A party atmosphere without any air<br><br>
He beats the heat with a cool calypso beat<br><br>
<br><br>
No workin hard like banana man<br><br>
<br><br>
He'd rather build castles in the sand<br><br>
<br><br>
Or swim in the blue green caribbean<br><br>
<br><br>
But his favorite place to go is<br><br>
Stingray city on the ocean floor<br><br>
<br><br>
With friendly fish and a reef to explore<br><br>
<br><br>
Coral gardens and a sandbar too<br><br>
<br><br>
Come on down so turtle bob can swim with you<br><br>
<br><br>
Having fun and swimming with the rays<br><br>
<br><br>
Is the most exciting part of bob's entire day<br><br>
<br><br>
He's got no troubles he's too busy blowing lots of little bubbles<br><br>
<br><br>
Sometimes when he's not swimming in the sea<br><br>
<br><br>
Turtle bob relaxes in a tropical breeze<br><br>
<br><br>
He likes to dance in the sand to a steel drum band<br><br>
<br><br>
But his favorite place to go is<br><br>
Stingray city on the ocean floor<br><br>
<br><br>
With friendly fish and a reef to explore<br><br>
<br><br>
Coral gardens and a sandbar too<br><br>
<br><br>
Come on down so turtle bob can swim with you<br><br>
<br><br>
But his favorite place to go is<br><br>
<br><br>
Stingray city on the ocean floor<br><br>
<br><br>
With friendly fish and a reef to explore<br><br>
<br><br>
Coral gardens and a sandbar too<br><br>
<br><br>
Come on down so turtle bob can swim with you<br><br>
<br><br>
Stingray city on the ocean floor<br><br>
<br><br>
With friendly fish and a reef to explore<br><br>
Coral gardens and a sandbar too<br><br>
<br><br>
Come on down so turtle bob can swim with you<br><br>
Stingray city on the ocean floor<br><br>
<br><br>
With friendly fish and a reef to explore<br><br>
<br><br>
Coral gardens and a sandbar too<br><br>
<br><br>
Come on down so turtle bob can swim with you<br><br>
Stingray city on the ocean floor<br><br>
<br><br>
With friendly fish and a reef to explore<br><br>
<br><br>
Coral gardens and a sandbar too
