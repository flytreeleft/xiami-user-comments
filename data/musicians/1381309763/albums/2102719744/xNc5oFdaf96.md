## 歌词

<div>
Oh the grand old Duke of York<br><br>
He had ten thousand men<br><br>
<br><br>
He marched them up to the top of<br><br>
The hill and he marched<br><br>
Them down again<br><br>
<br><br>
And when they were up they were up<br><br>
And when they were down they were down<br><br>
And when they were only half way up<br><br>
They were neither up nor down<br><br>
<br><br>
Oh the grand old Duke of York<br><br>
He had ten thousand men<br><br>
He marched them up to the top of<br><br>
The hill and he marched<br><br>
Them down again<br><br>
And when they were up they were up<br><br>
<br><br>
And when they were down they were down<br><br>
And when they were only half way up<br><br>
They were neither up nor down
</div>
