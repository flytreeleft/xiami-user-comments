## 歌词

<div>
What on earth am I meant to do <br><br>
In this crowded place there is only you <br><br>
Was gonna to leave now I have to stay <br><br>
You have taken my breath away <br><br>
Wow <br><br>
Is the world still spinning around <br><br>
Wow <br><br>
I don't feel like coming down <br><br>
It's in your eyes <br><br>
I can tell what your thinking <br><br>
My heart is sinking too <br><br>
It's no surprise <br><br>
I've been watching you lately <br><br>
I want to make it with you <br><br>
Oh oh oh <br><br>
Destiny has a funny way <br><br>
When it comes and takes all your cares away <br><br>
I can't think of a single thing <br><br>
Other than what a beautiful state I'm in <br><br>
Wow <br><br>
Is the world still spinning around <br><br>
Wow <br><br>
I don't feel like coming down <br><br>
It's in your eyes <br><br>
I can tell what your thinking <br><br>
My heart is sinking too <br><br>
It's no surprise <br><br>
I've been watching you lately <br><br>
I want to make it with you <br><br>
It's in your eyes <br><br>
I can tell what your thinking <br><br>
My heart is sinking too <br><br>
It's no surprise <br><br>
I've been watching you lately <br><br>
I want to make it with you oh <br><br>
A a <br><br>
Is the world still spinning around <br><br>
I don't feel like coming down <br><br>
