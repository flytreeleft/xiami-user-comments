## 歌词

<div>
Look at me<br><br>
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree<br><br>
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud<br><br>
I can't understand<br><br>
Walk my way And a thousand violins begin to play<br><br>
Or it might be the sound of your hello<br><br>
The music I hear<br><br>
I get misty the moment you're near<br><br>
you can't say that you're leading me on<br><br>
and it's just what I want you to do<br><br>
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost<br><br>
That's why I'm following you<br><br>
On my own<br><br>
Would I wander through this wonderland alone<br><br>
Never knowing my right foot from my left<br><br>
My hat from my glove<br><br>
I'm too misty and too much in love<br><br>
Too misty and too much in love
</div>
