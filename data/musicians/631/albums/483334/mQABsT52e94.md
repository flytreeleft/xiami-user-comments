<div>
(Santa Claus is coming)<br><br>
(Santa Claus is coming to town)<br><br>
(Santa Claus is coming)<br><br>
(Santa Claus is coming to town)<br><br>
Oh! You better watch out,<br><br>
You better not cry,<br><br>
You better not pout,<br><br>
I'm telling you why,<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming to town,<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming to town,<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming to town,<br><br>
He's making a list checkin it twice,<br><br>
He's gonna find out whos naughty or nice,<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming to town,<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming to town,<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming to town,<br><br>
He sees you when you're sleeping,<br><br>
He knows when you're awake,<br><br>
He knows when you've been bad or good,<br><br>
So be good for goodness sake!<br><br>
Oh! You better watch out,<br><br>
You better not cry,<br><br>
You better not pout,<br><br>
I'm telling you why,<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming to town,<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming to town,<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming to town,<br><br>
(Santa Claus is coming)<br><br>
(Santa Claus is coming to town)<br><br>
(Santa Claus is coming)<br><br>
(Santa Claus is coming to town)<br><br>
The kids in Girl and Boy Land<br><br>
will have a jubilee.<br><br>
They're gonna build a toyland town<br><br>
all around the Christmas tree.<br><br>
Oh! You better watch out,<br><br>
You better not cry,<br><br>
You better not pout,<br><br>
I'm telling you why,<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming to town,<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming to town,<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming to town,<br><br>
(Santa Claus is coming)<br><br>
(Santa Claus is coming to town)<br><br>
(Santa Claus come, Santa Claus come, Santa Claus come, come, coming to town)<br><br>
(Santa Claus come, Santa Claus come, Santa Claus come, come, coming to town)<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming to town,<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming to town,<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming (He's coming to town)<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming (He's coming to town)<br><br>
Santa Claus is coming,<br><br>
He's coming to town.
