## 歌词

<div>
you've got to learn to show a happy face<br><br>
although you're full of misery<br><br>
you mustn't show a trace of sadness<br><br>
never look for sympathy<br><br>
you've got to learn although it's very hard<br><br>
the way of pocketing your pride<br><br>
sometimes face humiliation<br><br>
while you were burning up inside<br><br>
<br><br>
facing reality is often hard to do<br><br>
when it seems happiness is gone<br><br>
you've got to learn to hide your tears<br><br>
and tell your heart life must go on<br><br>
<br><br>
you've got to learn to leave the table<br><br>
when love's no longer being served<br><br>
to show everybody that you are able<br><br>
to leave without saying a word<br><br>
<br><br>
you've got to learn to hide your sorrow<br><br>
and go on living as before<br><br>
what good is thinking of tomorrow<br><br>
who knows what it may have in store<br><br>
<br><br>
you've got to learn to be much stronger<br><br>
at times your head must rule your heart<br><br>
you've got to learn from hard experience<br><br>
and listen to advice<br><br>
and sometimes pay the price<br><br>
and learn to live with a broken heart
</div>
