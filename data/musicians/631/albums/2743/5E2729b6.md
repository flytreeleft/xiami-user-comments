## 歌词

<div>
crazy for you<br><br>
林一峰<br><br>
<br><br>
lyrics by 猪雄<br><br>
<br><br>
swaying room as the music starts<br><br>
strangers making the most of the dark<br><br>
two by two their bodies become one<br><br>
<br><br>
i see you through the smokey air<br><br>
can't you feel the weight of my stare<br><br>
you're so close but still a world away<br><br>
what i'm dying to say, is that<br><br>
i'm crazy for you<br><br>
touch me once and you will know it's true<br><br>
i never wanted anyone like this<br><br>
it's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss<br><br>
i'm crazy for you, crazy for you<br><br>
<br><br>
trying hard to control my heart<br><br>
i walk over to where you are<br><br>
eye to eye we meet no words at all<br><br>
<br><br>
slowly now we begin to move<br><br>
every breath i'm deeper into you<br><br>
send me to a standing still in time<br><br>
if you read my mind, you'll see<br><br>
i'm crazy for you<br><br>
touch me once and you'll know it's true<br><br>
i never wanted anyone like this<br><br>
it's all brand new, you'll feel it in my ooo....<br><br>
oh so crazy for you<br><br>
touch me once and you will know it's true<br><br>
i never wanted anyone like this<br><br>
it's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss<br><br>
i'm crazy for you<br><br>
crazy for you<br><br>
crazy for you<br><br>
i'm crazy for you
