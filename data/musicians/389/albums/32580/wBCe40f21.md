## 歌词

<div>
Top of the worldCarpenters<br><br>
Such a feelin's.in' over me<br><br>
There is wonder in most everthing I see<br><br>
Not a cloud in the sky got the sun in my eyes<br><br>
and I won't be surprised if it's a dream<br><br>
Everything I want the world to be<br><br>
Is now.ing true especially for me<br><br>
and the reason is clear<br><br>
It's because you are here<br><br>
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen<br><br>
I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation<br><br>
and the only explanation I can find<br><br>
Is the love that I've found<br><br>
Every since  you've been around your love<br><br>
Put me at the top of the world<br><br>
Something in the wind has learned my name<br><br>
And it's tellin' me that things are not the same<br><br>
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze<br><br>
There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me<br><br>
There is only one wish on my mind<br><br>
When this day is through I hope that I will find<br><br>
that tomorrow will be just the same for you and me<br><br>
All I need will be mine if you are here<br><br>
